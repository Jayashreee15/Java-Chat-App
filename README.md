💬 Java Chat Application

A *real-time group chat system* built using *Java Socket Programming* and *Multithreading*.  
This project demonstrates the fundamentals of *client-server communication, **message broadcasting, and **network concurrency*.

 🧠 Overview

The *Java Chat Application* enables multiple users to exchange messages over a network in real-time.  
It uses *TCP sockets* to ensure reliable data transfer and *threads* to handle multiple clients simultaneously.  
Each client connected to the server can send messages that are broadcast to all other connected users.
This project serves as a great starting point to understand Java networking concepts and can be extended with features like private messaging, file sharing, and encryption.

 ⚙ Features

- Real-time group chat between multiple users  
- TCP-based reliable communication  
- Multi-threaded client handling  
- Message broadcasting system  
- Console-based interface (can be extended to GUI)  
- Secure socket stream management

 🚀 How to Run

 *1️⃣ Compile the Server*
```bash
javac Server.java
java Server

2️⃣ Compile and Run Clients (in different terminals)
javac Client.java
java Client

3️⃣ Chat!

Type messages in the client console.
Each message is broadcast to all connected users.

🔍 Working Principle

The server listens for incoming connections using ServerSocket.

Each connected client is handled by a separate thread (ClientHandler).

Messages from one client are broadcast to all others via shared streams.

The multi-threaded design ensures that one slow client doesn’t affect others.

💡 Applications

Real-time group chat for classrooms or teams

Internal communication tool for organizations

Prototype for advanced chat platforms (e.g., WhatsApp, Messenger)

Learning model for socket programming and concurrency

🧱 Future Enhancements

Graphical User Interface (GUI) using JavaFX or Swing

End-to-end message encryption

Private chat / direct messaging

User authentication system

File transfer and media sharing

Cloud-based server deployment

🏁 Conclusion

The Java Chat Application provides a solid foundation for learning and implementing networked communication systems in Java.
It enhances understanding of TCP socket programming, client-server architecture, and thread synchronization.
This project can be easily expanded into a modern chat system with GUI and secure data handling.
